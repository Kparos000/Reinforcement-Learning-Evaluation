You will receive:
- ORIGINAL: a short context paragraph.
- FACTS: a list of canonical facts that MUST be preserved.
- BANNED: a list of terms you MUST NOT introduce.

Your job has TWO parts:
(1) Rewrite ORIGINAL to be concise (≤60% of original characters) WITHOUT losing any FACTS.
(2) Produce ACE-style reflection/curation.

Output ONLY a JSON object with EXACTLY these keys:
{
  "rewrite": str,
  "preserved_facts": [str],
  "at_risk_facts": [str],
  "key_insight": str,
  "delta_update": str
}

Rules:
- The rewrite must include every item from FACTS (verbatim or allowed alias).
- Do NOT add new claims; avoid any term from BANNED.
- Keep all numbers and units unchanged (e.g., 3.2%, $5.1B).
- Be concise but complete (≤60% of original characters).
- key_insight: one sentence on avoiding context collapse by preserving granular details.
- delta_update: one actionable curator bullet to add to a playbook.
- Output only the JSON (no extra prose).
