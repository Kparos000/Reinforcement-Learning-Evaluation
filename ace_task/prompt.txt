You will receive:
- ORIGINAL: a short context paragraph.
- FACTS: a list of canonical facts that MUST be preserved.
- BANNED: a list of terms you MUST NOT introduce.

Your job has TWO parts:
(1) Rewrite ORIGINAL in your own words, but keep it UNDER 60% of the original character count AND at most 16 words.
    - You will automatically FAIL if it is longer.
    - Remove filler words and redundancies; keep all facts and numbers unchanged.
    - Produce a tight executive summary: short, factual, precise.
(2) Produce ACE-style reflection/curation after the rewrite.

Output ONLY a valid JSON object with EXACTLY these keys:
{
  "rewrite": str,
  "preserved_facts": [str],
  "at_risk_facts": [str],
  "key_insight": str,
  "delta_update": str
}

Rules:
- The rewrite must include every item from FACTS (verbatim or via allowed alias).
- Do NOT add new claims or unrelated context; avoid any term from BANNED.
- Keep numeric values, dates, and units unchanged (e.g., 3.2%, $5.1B, 2024).
- key_insight: one sentence on preserving quantitative detail to avoid context collapse.
- delta_update: one actionable step for future summaries (e.g., “Use numeric shorthand; cut connectors.”).
- Output only the JSON — no extra commentary.

Example (≤16 words, <60% chars):

ORIGINAL:
In Q2, GDP grew by 3.2% while inflation was 2.1%. Exports increased as supply chains normalized.

FACTS:
- GDP grew by 3.2%
- inflation was 2.1%
- exports increased

BANNED:
- recession
- budget deficit $9.9B

Valid JSON example:
{
  "rewrite": "Q2: GDP +3.2%, inflation 2.1%; exports increased.",
  "preserved_facts": ["GDP grew by 3.2%", "inflation was 2.1%", "exports increased"],
  "at_risk_facts": [],
  "key_insight": "Exact metrics (3.2%, 2.1%) prevent context collapse under compression.",
  "delta_update": "Prefer numeric shorthand and semicolons to reduce words without losing facts or units."
}
